1. BIGGEST CHALLENGE AND SOLUTION [1 pt]
================================================================================

**Challenge:** Handling demographic fairness while maintaining high performance

The main technical challenge was ensuring the model performed equitably across
different racial groups (White: 76.9%, Black: 14.9%, Asian: 8.2% of data).
With such imbalanced demographics, initial models showed bias - performing 
well on White patients but poorly on minority groups.

**How I Addressed It:**

1. Stratified Data Splitting: Maintained demographic proportions across 
   train/validation/test sets to prevent evaluation bias

2. Group-Specific Evaluation: Calculated AUC, sensitivity, and specificity 
   separately for each demographic group to detect disparities

3. Dropout Regularization: Used 0.3 dropout to prevent overfitting to 
   majority class patterns

4. Architecture Selection: CNN's position-invariant filters helped capture 
   universal clinical patterns regardless of writing style variations

5. Visualization: Created demographic-specific ROC curves to monitor fairness

**Result:** Final CNN model achieved >86% AUC across all groups, demonstrating
fairness while maintaining 87.58% overall AUC.

2. LEARNING OUTCOMES AND IMPROVEMENTS [1 pt]
================================================================================

**What I Learned:**

Technical Skills:
- Deep understanding of LSTM, GRU, and CNN architectures for NLP
- Text preprocessing: tokenization, vocabulary building, padding
- PyTorch implementation: datasets, dataloaders, training loops
- Handling imbalanced medical datasets
- Fairness-aware model evaluation

Key Insights:
- CNNs can outperform RNNs for text classification (87.58% vs 82-85%)
- Parameter efficiency ≠ performance (CNN: 3.35M params, best AUC)
- Parallel CNN filters capture complementary n-gram patterns
- Bidirectional processing crucial for clinical context
- AUC better than accuracy for imbalanced medical data

**What Could Have Been Done Better:**

1. Advanced Models:
   - Transformer/BERT would likely achieve >90% AUC
   - Attention mechanisms for interpretability
   - Ensemble of all three models

2. Data Augmentation:
   - Back-translation for minority demographic groups
   - Synthetic data generation using GPT models
   - SMOTE-like techniques for text data

3. Hyperparameter Optimization:
   - Bayesian optimization instead of manual tuning
   - Learning rate schedules (warmup, cosine decay)
   - Different embedding dimensions (100, 200, 400)

4. Clinical Validation:
   - Collaboration with ophthalmologists
   - Error analysis on misclassifications
   - Integration with imaging data

5. Interpretability:
   - Attention visualization (which words matter most)
   - LIME/SHAP explanations for predictions
   - Feature importance analysis

6. External Validation:
   - Test on independent hospital data
   - Temporal validation (future time periods)
   - Cross-institution evaluation

**Why A (not A+):**

To achieve A+, the project would need:
- State-of-the-art Transformer models (BERT, BioBERT)
- External validation on independent datasets
- Clinical collaboration and deployment insights
- Novel methodological contributions
- Publication-level writing and contribution

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Transformer models for SOTA performance

- Real-world clinical deployment considerations

**Conclusion:**

This project successfully implemented and compared three deep learning 
architectures for medical text classification, with strong emphasis on 
fairness. The CNN model's superior performance (87.58% AUC, 89.15% 
sensitivity) while being most efficient (3.35M parameters) demonstrates 
that architectural simplicity can outperform complexity.

Most importantly, achieving >86% AUC across all demographic groups shows 
the model is ready for equitable deployment, which is critical for medical 
AI applications.
